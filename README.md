Heart Disease Indicators

Project Overview:
In this project, I delved into the realm of health analytics, specifically focusing on heart disease prediction. Utilizing the comprehensive Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset from Kaggle, the project aims to uncover the intricate connections between various health factors and the likelihood of heart disease.

Objectives:
The primary goal is to predict heart disease occurrences by analyzing an array of health indicators. This involves a detailed exploratory data analysis to identify key patterns and relationships within the data.

Methodology:
To achieve our objectives, the project employs Python's robust data science libraries. Initial steps include rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the analysis. The exploratory phase examines various health indicators, seeking patterns and notable correlations with heart disease cases.

Advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), form the core of our predictive analysis. These methods allow for the development of models capable of predicting heart disease based on the identified risk factors.
